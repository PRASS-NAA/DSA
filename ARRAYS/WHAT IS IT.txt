Data Structures (ARRAY)

we can divide ds into two categories

linear and non linear

LINEAR DS
In linear ds, the elements form a sequence
sequence can be formed in two ways
1. The elements of the ds are stored in sequential memory address (Arrays).
2. The elements of the ds have linear relationship between others by means of pointers (Linked List).

ARRAYS
------

Arrays are linear ds, which stores finite number of similar elements.

finite -> fixed size
similar -> homogenous (Same data type)

Array Declaration
-----------------

int rollno[5] -> if decalred globally (initialized with 0), if declared locally initialized with garbage values.

int rollno[] = {1,2,3,4,5} compiler automatically calculates the size of array.

int rollno[5] = {1,2} first two elements initialized, remaining garbage or 0 based on scope.

int rollno[5] = {0} initializes all elements to 0.


2-D ARRAYS
----------

int class[2][5] two rows 5 cols

(Everything is linear in memory, so memory representation of 2d array would be base don row-major or column-major arrangement -> C accepts row major only , Pascal accepts Column major)

To find address of an element a[i][j] in a[m][n] matrix -> base address + i*n +j

for column major arrangement -> base address + j*n +j
